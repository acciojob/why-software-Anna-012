	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Becoming a developer offers an exciting and fulfilling journey, driven by the combination of creativity, problem-solving, and the potential to build solutions that have a real impact on the world. As technology continues to shape nearly every aspect of our lives—from how we communicate and work to how we shop and entertain ourselves—being a developer means not only being at the forefront of this revolution but also having the power to influence its direction. My passion for development stems from several interconnected
		motivations that drive my desire to become part of this dynamic field.</p>
